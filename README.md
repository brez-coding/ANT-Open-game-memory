This is a recreation of the game Memory;
Made for ANT Open 2025 June 1st by Ivelin Valkanov in category "Kalfa"

# Customisations:
You can choose a custom character palette
You can play singleplayer or multiplayer
You can choose a custom grid size (which needs to pass certain conditions)

# How to play:
You flip two cards every turn. If they're the same, they remain visible untill the end of the game. If they aren't, they're flipped back down. The goal is to match all the pairs. In multiplayer players take turns and the winner is the one who revealed more cards. After the end of a singleplayer game, you will be told if you have a new highscore, and if you don't it will tell you your current score and the highscore. Those values depend on what size grid you have.
